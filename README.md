# MonoDepth

This repo is inspired by an amazing work of [Cl√©ment Godard](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/C.Godard/), [Oisin Mac Aodha](http://vision.caltech.edu/~macaodha/) and [Gabriel J. Brostow](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/g.brostow/) for Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation.

## MonoDepth-PyTorch
This repository contains code and additional parts for the PyTorch port of the MonoDepth Deep Learning algorithm. For more information about original work please visit [author's websiet](http://visual.cs.ucl.ac.uk/pubs/monoDepth/)

## Purpose

Purpose of this repository is to make more lightweighted model for depth estimation with better accuracy.

## Train results

The following results may be obtained using the model pretrained for **150** epochs on the whole dataset with initial **lr = 0.01**

## Dataset
### KITTI

This algorithm requires stereo-pair images for training and single images for testing.
[KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php) dataset was used for training.
It contains 38237 training samples.
Raw dataset (about 175 GB) can be downloaded by running:
```shell
wget -i utils/kitti_archives_to_download.txt -P ~/my/output/folder/
```
## Dataloader
Dataloader assumes the following structure of the folder with train examples (**'data_dir'** argument contains path to that folder):
    <p>It contains subfolders with folders "image_02/data" for left images and  "image_03/data" for right images
    Such structure is default for KITTI dataset
    
## Training
Example of training can be find in Monodepth notebook.

Model class from main_monodepth_pytorch.py should be initialized with following params (as easydict) for training:
 - 'data_dir': path to the dataset folder
 - 'model_path': path to save the trained model
 - 'output_directory': where save dispairities for tested images
 - 'input_height'
 - 'input_width'
 - 'model': model for encoder (resnet18 or resnet50)
 - 'mode': train or test
 - 'epochs': number of epochs,
 - 'learning_rate'
 - 'batch_size'
 - 'adjust_lr': apply learning rate decay or not
 - 'tensor_type':'torch.cuda.FloatTensor' or 'torch.FloatTensor'
 - 'do_augmentation':do data augmentation or not
 - 'augment_parameters':lowest and highest values for gamma, lightness and color respectively'
 - 'print_images'
 - 'print_weights'
 
<p>After that calling train() on Model class object starts training process 
    
## Testing
Example of testing can be find in Monodepth notebook.

Model class from main_monodepth_pytorch.py should be initialized with following params (as easydict) for testing:
 - 'data_dir': path to the dataset folder
 - 'model_path': path to save the trained model
 - 'output_directory': where save dispairities for tested images
 - 'input_height'
 - 'input_width'
 - 'model': model for encoder (resnet18 or resnet50)
 - 'mode': train or test
 
<p>After that calling test() on Model class object starts testing process
    
## Requirements
This code was tested with PyTorch 0.4.0, CUDA 9.1 and Ubuntu 16.04.
